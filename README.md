# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in C++


A clean implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ using linked nodes, featuring essential operations with efficient time complexities.

## Features

- **Core Operations**:
  - Insertion (`O(log n)` average, `O(n)` worst)
  - Deletion (`O(log n)` average, `O(n)` worst)
  - Search (`O(log n)` average, `O(n)` worst)
  
- **Utility Functions**:
  - In-order traversal (`O(n)`)
  - Tree height calculation (`O(n)`)
  - Node counting (`O(n)`)

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Memory-efficient linked node structure
  - Recursive algorithm implementations
  - Proper memory management

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd bst-cpp
